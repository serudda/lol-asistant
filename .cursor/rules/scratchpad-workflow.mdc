# Scratchpad Workflow

This project uses a scratchpad-based workflow to track progress using a multi-agent approach.

## Scratchpad Location

- [.cursor/scratchpad.md](mdc:.cursor/scratchpad.md) - The central file for tracking project progress

## Workflow Roles

The project uses two main roles in development:

1. **Planner** - Responsible for high-level analysis, task breakdown, and defining success criteria
2. **Executor** - Handles implementation details, executing tasks from the scratchpad

## Scratchpad Sections

The scratchpad is organized into these key sections:

- **Background and Motivation** - Project context and goals
- **Key Challenges and Analysis** - Major challenges and analysis
- **High-Level Task Breakdown** - Step-by-step implementation plan
- **Project Status Board** - Task tracking checklist
- **Executor Comments or Assistance Requests** - Implementation notes
- **Lessons** - Reusable knowledge and error solutions

## Development Process

1. New tasks are first analyzed by the Planner
2. Tasks are broken down into small steps with clear success criteria
3. The Executor implements one task at a time
4. Progress is reported in the scratchpad
5. The Planner reviews completed work before proceeding
